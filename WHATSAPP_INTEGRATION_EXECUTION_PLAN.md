## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
WhatsApp → Chatwoot → Webhook → Edge Function → GCS + Database → AI Pipeline
```

### Storage Strategy
- **User Isolation**: One GCS bucket per user for complete data separation
- **Real-time Access**: Supabase database for metadata and processing status
- **Dynamic Creation**: Buckets created automatically when first message arrives
- **Cost Optimization**: Lifecycle policies applied to each user bucket automatically

### Security Framework
- All communication over HTTPS
- Service account with minimal required permissions
- Audit logging for all data access
- GDPR compliance for EU users

## Resource Requirements

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)
- **GCS Storage**: $50-200 (depending on volume, slightly higher due to bucket overhead)
- **GCS Operations**: $10-30 (bucket creation/management operations)
- **Supabase Edge Functions**: $25-100 (based on execution time)
- **Database Storage**: $10-50 (incremental)
- **Monitoring & Logging**: $20-40

### Development Resources
- **Backend Engineer**: 80 hours (database, edge function, integration)
- **DevOps Engineer**: 40 hours (infrastructure, deployment, monitoring)
- **Product Manager**: 20 hours (requirements, testing, documentation)

### Operational Resources
- **Initial Setup**: 16 hours
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: 4 hours/week
- **Maintenance**: 8 hours/month

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| GCS Service Disruption | Low | High | Fallback to Supabase storage |
| Edge Function Cold Starts | Medium | Medium | Pre-warming strategies |
| Webhook Delivery Failures | Medium | High | Dead letter queue implementation |
| Data Loss During Processing | Low | Critical | Atomic transactions and rollback procedures |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Cost Overruns | Medium | Medium | Spending alerts and usage caps |
| GDPR Compliance Issues | Low | High | Legal review and data encryption |
| User Adoption Challenges | Medium | Medium | User training and documentation |
| Performance Degradation | Low | High | Load testing and performance monitoring |

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] 99.9% webhook processing success rate
- [ ] <500ms average processing latency
- [ ] Zero data loss incidents
- [ ] All messages properly stored in GCS and database

### Long-term Success Metrics
- **Technical KPIs**:
  - Message processing throughput: >1000 messages/hour
  - Storage cost efficiency: <$0.001 per message
  - System uptime: >99.95%

- **Business KPIs**:
  - User engagement with WhatsApp-derived content: +25%
  - Content generation accuracy improvement: +15%
  - Time to insight from conversations: -60%

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Progression
1. **Development**: Local testing and integration
2. **Staging**: Full end-to-end testing with production data volume
3. **Production**: Phased rollout with feature flags

### Feature Flag Strategy
```typescript
// Gradual rollout approach
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  whatsapp_ingestion: {
    enabled: true,
    rollout_percentage: 100
  },
  ai_processing: {
    enabled: false,
    rollout_percentage: 0
  }
};
```

### Rollback Plan
- **Immediate**: Disable webhook in Chatwoot (manual, <5 minutes)
- **Function Level**: Revert edge function deployment (automated, <2 minutes)
- **Database Level**: Apply rollback migration (manual, <10 minutes)

## Monitoring & Observability

### Critical Alerts
- Edge function error rate >1%
- GCS storage costs >$300/month
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Webhook processing latency >1000ms

### Dashboards
1. **Operational Dashboard**: Real-time processing metrics
2. **Business Dashboard**: Message volume and user engagement
3. **Cost Dashboard**: Infrastructure spending and optimization opportunities

### Logging Strategy
- **Application Logs**: Structured JSON with correlation IDs
- **Audit Logs**: All data access and modification events
- **Performance Logs**: Latency and throughput metrics

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics (Month 2)
- Conversation sentiment tracking
