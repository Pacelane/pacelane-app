# Onboarding Redirect Fix

## Issue Description

Users were being sent to the onboarding flow on every login, even after completing onboarding. This created a poor user experience where returning users had to go through the entire onboarding process repeatedly.

## Root Cause

The application was missing onboarding completion checks in the authentication flow. When users signed in, they were automatically redirected to `/product-home` regardless of their onboarding status, and there was no validation to ensure users had completed onboarding before accessing protected routes.

## Solution

Implemented comprehensive onboarding completion checks in two key components:

### 1. ProtectedRoute Component (`src/design-system/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added `profile` to the `useAuth()` hook destructuring
- Added profile loading state check
- Added onboarding completion validation
- Redirect users to `/onboarding/welcome` if onboarding is incomplete

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
const { user, loading } = useAuth();

// After  
const { user, profile, loading } = useAuth();

// Added profile loading state
if (!profile) {
  return (
    <div style={{...}}>
      <SpinningBichaurinho title="Loading your profile..." />
    </div>
  );
}

// Added onboarding completion check
if (!profile.onboarding_completed) {
  return <Navigate to="/onboarding/welcome" replace />;
}
```

### 2. SignIn Component (`src/pages/SignIn.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added `profile` to the `useAuth()` hook destructuring
- Updated redirect logic to check onboarding completion status
- Updated both email/password and Google sign-in flows

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
const { user, signIn, signUp, signInWithGoogle } = useAuth();

// After
const { user, profile, signIn, signUp, signInWithGoogle } = useAuth();

// Updated redirect logic
useEffect(() => {
  if (user && profile) {
    if (profile.onboarding_completed) {
      navigate('/product-home');
    } else {
      navigate('/onboarding/welcome');
    }
  }
}, [user, profile, navigate]);
```

## How It Works Now

### User Flow

1. **First-time users (Sign Up):**
   - Complete sign up process
   - Redirected to `/onboarding/welcome`
   - Complete onboarding flow
   - `onboarding_completed` set to `true` in database
   - Redirected to `/product-home`

2. **Returning users with completed onboarding:**
   - Sign in successfully
   - Profile loaded with `onboarding_completed: true`
   - Redirected directly to `/product-home`
   - Can access all protected routes

3. **Returning users with incomplete onboarding:**
   - Sign in successfully
   - Profile loaded with `onboarding_completed: false`
   - Redirected to `/onboarding/welcome`
   - Must complete onboarding before accessing protected routes

### Protected Route Behavior

All protected routes now automatically:
- Check if user is authenticated
- Check if profile is loaded
- Check if onboarding is completed
- Redirect to appropriate location based on status

## Database Schema

The fix relies on the `onboarding_completed` field in the `profiles` table:

```sql
-- profiles table structure
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  onboarding_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  -- ... other fields
);
```

## Testing

### Test Cases

1. **New User Sign Up:**
   - [ ] User signs up with email/password
   - [ ] User is redirected to onboarding
   - [ ] User completes onboarding
   - [ ] User is redirected to product home
   - [ ] User can access protected routes

2. **Returning User with Completed Onboarding:**
   - [ ] User signs in with email/password
   - [ ] User is redirected directly to product home
   - [ ] User can access all protected routes

3. **Returning User with Incomplete Onboarding:**
   - [ ] User signs in with email/password
   - [ ] User is redirected to onboarding
   - [ ] User must complete onboarding before accessing protected routes

4. **Google Sign In:**
   - [ ] User signs in with Google
   - [ ] User is redirected based on onboarding status
   - [ ] Behavior matches email/password sign in

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Create a new user account
2. Verify redirect to onboarding flow
3. Complete onboarding process
4. Sign out and sign back in
5. Verify redirect to product home (not onboarding)
6. Test with Google sign in
7. Test with incomplete onboarding user

## Files Modified

- `src/design-system/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- `src/pages/SignIn.tsx`
- `src/pages/GoogleCalendarCallback.tsx` (updated comment for clarity)

## Dependencies

- `useAuth` hook must provide `profile` data
- `profile.onboarding_completed` field must be properly set in database
- Profile loading must complete before redirect decisions

## Future Considerations

1. **Onboarding Progress Tracking:** Consider implementing partial onboarding completion tracking
2. **Onboarding Skip Option:** Allow users to skip certain onboarding steps
3. **Onboarding Reset:** Provide admin functionality to reset user onboarding status
4. **Analytics:** Track onboarding completion rates and drop-off points
