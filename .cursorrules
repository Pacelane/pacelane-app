# Pacelane Development Guidelines

## Mission & Vision

Pacelane solves content consistency for executives. We help B2B executives capture insights in real-time and build publishing habits that drive 3x better conversion rates than company-branded posts.

**Core Problem:** 80% of executives post less than once per week due to time constraints, not lack of insights.

**Our Approach (vs competitors focusing on AI writing quality):**
1. **Context Capture:** Integrate with existing workflows to catch content opportunities in real-time
2. **Execution Accountability:** Make content creation as habitual as checking email
3. **Market Intelligence:** Understand what resonates with specific audiences

**Market Validation:** 2.8M executives on LinkedIn, <10% post weekly. Traktor data shows 40% more qualified leads for consistent posters.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Modern React with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive design
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI components
- Context API for state management
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Backend (Supabase)
- PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Edge Functions for AI processing and integrations
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- File storage with Google Cloud Storage integration
- Authentication with Supabase Auth

### Key Integrations
- WhatsApp Business API for content distribution
- Google Cloud Storage for knowledge base files
- LinkedIn (planned) for content publishing
- AI services for content generation and analysis

## Development Principles

### 1. Executive-First Design
- **Simplicity:** Executives are busy - every interaction should be frictionless
- **Mobile-First:** Content capture happens on mobile devices
- **Habit Formation:** Design for daily usage patterns
- **Context Preservation:** Never lose an insight due to poor UX

### 2. Content Workflow Focus
- **Capture → Process → Publish** flow should be seamless
- **Real-time Processing:** AI suggestions should appear instantly
- **Draft Management:** Easy save, edit, and scheduling capabilities
- **Multi-format Support:** Text, audio, video, and image content

### 3. Accountability & Engagement
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual indicators of posting consistency
- **Smart Reminders:** Context-aware notifications
- **Gamification:** Streaks, goals, and achievements
- **Social Proof:** Audience engagement metrics

### 4. Market Intelligence
- **Audience Analytics:** What content resonates with specific audiences
- **Performance Tracking:** Conversion rates and lead generation
- **A/B Testing:** Content format and timing optimization
- **Competitive Analysis:** Industry benchmark comparisons

2. **Content Processing:** AI-powered content suggestions and optimization
3. **Publishing Workflow:** Multi-platform publishing with scheduling
4. **Analytics Dashboard:** Performance tracking and insights

### Medium Priority
1. **Team Collaboration:** Multi-user accounts and content approval
2. **Advanced AI:** Personalized content recommendations
3. **Integration Ecosystem:** CRM, calendar, and social media platforms
4. **Mobile App:** Native mobile experience

### Low Priority
1. **White-label Solutions:** Custom branding for agencies
2. **Enterprise Features:** SSO, advanced permissions, compliance
3. **API Access:** Third-party integrations and webhooks

## Security & Privacy

- Best practices and tips

## Performance Requirements

### Frontend Performance
- < 3 second initial page load
- < 1 second for subsequent interactions
- Optimized bundle sizes and lazy loading
- Progressive enhancement for slow connections

### Backend Performance
- < 500ms API response times
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Scalable architecture for growth

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast requirements
- Focus management and indicators

### Mobile Accessibility
- Touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
